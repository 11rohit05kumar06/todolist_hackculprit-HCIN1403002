1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the design, development, and implementation of the project titled "Full-Stack To-Do List Web Application", undertaken as part of the Hack Culprit Virtual Internship. The objective was to build a practical, technically sound solution using modern tools and frameworks. The project enhances key skills such as problem-solving, collaboration through GitHub, and real-world application of theoretical knowledge.

2. Problem Statement
Managing daily tasks without a structured tool can lead to decreased productivity and missed deadlines. This project aims to solve this by providing a clean, responsive, and persistent to-do list application that enables users to create, schedule, and manage tasks with time-based reminders.

3. Project Objectives
To gain practical exposure to full-cycle software development
To apply learned concepts in a real-world scenario
To utilize version control and collaborative tools effectively
To develop a feature-rich application that addresses a real problem

4. Development Approach
The project was completed in four key stages:
Requirement Analysis & Planning – Defined core features like task scheduling, reminders, and persistence
Development – Built frontend and backend using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js
Testing & Debugging – Performed testing, resolved bugs, and ensured smooth UI interactions
Documentation & Deployment – Created a detailed README and organized the project repository

5. Tools & Technologies
Category	Tools / Technologies Used
Programming	JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Frameworks	Node.js, Express.js
Database	JSON file storage
Tools	Git, GitHub, VS Code

6. Installation & Setup
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

8. Demonstration
A live walkthrough or screenshots can be added here.
Optionally, host the project and share the URL or link to a demo video.

9. Challenges Encountered
Implementing time-based reminders with real-time checks
Managing persistent task storage using file-based methods
Achieving clean transitions and a minimalistic UI

10. Scope for Future Enhancements
User authentication and multi-user task segregation
Task categorization and priority tags
Cloud-based deployment (e.g., Firebase, Vercel)
Notification support on mobile devices

11. Conclusion
This internship project significantly contributed to my technical and professional development. It offered a comprehensive experience in applying theoretical concepts to solve real-world problems while adhering to industry standards in code quality and documentation.
